Within a decade, the campus had expanded to include numerous buildings, accommodating a growing student body and increased program offerings.Aside from expanding its physical presence in the county, in recent years the College has also added a suite of baccalaureate programs to its degree options. These include the Bachelor of Applied Science in Supervision and Management, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, the Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice, the Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Sciences, the Bachelor of Science in Early Childhood Education, and the Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education.In 2014, the College expanded again, adding the Polk State Clear Springs Advanced Technology Center.\\xa0 The 45,000-square-foot facility off State Road 60 in Bartow houses high-tech degree programs and the Polk State Corporate College, which provides workforce training.The growth continues at Polk State. In 2016, the Polk State Center for Public Safety opened in Winter Haven. The state-of-the-art facility houses the Polk State Kenneth C. Thompson Institute for Public Safety, as well as the College’s other public safety training and degree programs. The College also recently added a second location in South Lakeland, Polk State Airside Center East, to house its Aerospace Program; the original Airside location is now called Polk State Airside West and is home to the College’s medical imaging programs.Aside from expanding its physical presence in the county, in recent years the College has also added a suite of baccalaureate programs to its degree options.

The project is early in its conception, but was recognized for its unique community approach and potential impact.So he headed to Traviss Career Center in Lakeland, and started a two-year air conditioning training program.In 1995, he began working as a firefighter for the City of Lakeland, and soon he was back in school, this time at Polk State College. He earned his Associate in Science in Fire Science Technology in 2003 and his Associate of Science in EMS in 2005. He is now currently enrolled in the College’s Bachelor of Applied Science in Supervision and Management degree program.Polk’s EMS program, he said, offered him an education unrivaled by any other program in the area — and much of that has to do with EMS Program Director Don Guillette.Reynolds said that the quality of the EMS program is enhanced by the fact that Guillette and his instructors all have real-world experience; Guillette and many of his instructors still work in the EMS field.In his new role, one of his major responsibilities is to maintain certifications for EMTs, paramedics, advanced life support personnel, making sure the department is abiding by local and state guidelines. He also plans and oversees all in-house medical training for the department —\\xa0he also teaches many of the trainings and maintains related records. \\xa0He’s also in charge of the department’s quality assurance program, making sure medical calls are responded to quickly and appropriately, so patients receive the best possible care.In addition to his new position at the LFD, Reynolds also recently agreed to serve on the advisory board for Polk State’s EMS program.The EMS advisory board, like those for other College degree programs, is comprised of representatives from local employers and the College. In the case of the EMS program, Guillette explained, represented employers include Polk County Fire Rescue, the Winter Haven Fire Department, and other agencies.Through advisory boards, the College ensures that its programs are delivering training that is in demand by real-world employers.“It’s a chance to give back to a program that did a lot for me. What we do is a public service and the lion’s share of what we do is respond to medical calls. You have to get the firefighters you see in the movies out of your head. I’ve spent my career at busy stations, and put my hands on a lot of people — and it’s not always been roses,” Reynolds said. “EMS students need to really think about the realities of the job and whether they can stomach the realities of the job.”Shane Reynolds is rescue chief at the Lakeland Fire Department.
